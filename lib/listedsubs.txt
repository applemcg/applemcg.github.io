* canon -- user-defined, produces a canonical format of the app or library
* columns -- for [[/rdb]] applications, name the columns for a common table or tables
* comment -- //user defined//
* copyright -- for the library or app.
* count -- //user defined//, often, but not confined to [[/rdb]]
* demo -- //user defined//, however, it should contain prominent examples of function usage
* doc -- for a library, or an app, produces or shows a link to the user manual, where the user may be a developer
* entry -- for an [[app]], the function //appname//_entry, lists the [[entry points]] to the app.
* fields -- similar to ''columns'', may apply to csv, tsv files
* files -- //user defined//, must return a list of files
* functions -- like files, returns a list of functions
* hdr -- reserved by [[/rdb]] functions
* help -- produces a help message for an app or library.  the [[app_isa]] function supplies a default help for its app

* list -- //user defined//, returns list of functions, files, ...
* location -- //user defined//, return the name of a directory, a user location 
* main -- if an app was defined with onliy a family name, //famname//_main is the function surrogate for the //famname// [[app]]
* names -- //user defined//, usage overlaps with ''list''
* path -- //user defined//, return some  instance or variance of the user's ''PATH''
* rdb -- for ''/rdb'' applications, usually to convert input format to rdb
* record -- for ''/rdb'' applications, write a [[record]] for a particular [[table]] 
* table --  for ''/rdb'' applications, format a  [[table]] * test -- for a function //funcname_any//, the function //funcname_any_test// is a sufficient unit test.  also may be used for non-family functions
* version -- for a function library or app, returns the version
