And in a way I appreciated; it enabled me to relate the familiar names in those human terms: who liked whom and why.   The Vienna Circle was the "in" group of the day.   So, the politics played out there lived into the present at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton.   I'm a rank amateur philosopher, so her treatment of Wittgenstein, Hilbert, Russell, Schlick (the one who I hadn't known of before) .. enabled me, in ways reading secondary philosophic reading had not done for me before, to place those individuals theories in perspective.  For example, "early" vs "late" Wittgenstein.  If you know Wittgenstein, your cocktail conversation forces you to pick "early" or "late" depending on the tilt of the table.[return]Goldstein cured me of that.   While you'd think she's effectively bashing Wittgenstein, she leads you to realize, in ways not available to either Godel or Wittgenstein, they had more in common that they, or any contemporaries could see.   And maybe the temporal element is what kept them from seeing it.   Enter Einstein.[return][return](to be continued)...	4.5

Reich offers (if not introduces) a third way, between state-run liberal bureaucracy and laissez faire capitalism.  He advocates for a market and political system where the government sets the rules, and leaves the picking of the winners to the market.   His ideas are being tested now.[return][return]Reich makes his point by reviewing four American myths, three of which are[return] * The Rugged Individual[return] * The Supportive Community -- check me on this one, [return] * The Rot at the Top[return][return]I'll "have to get back to you" on the third in his list.   In each of the myths, he details how the right and the left have personalized the myth to promote their own view and discount the other.    His approach draws contemporary praise from the Wall St Journal, where they laud his challenge to the left.   Reich deftly steers what we on the left would call a "middle course",   between the extremes.   For example, his "Rot at the Top", as used by conservatives, refers to the government bureaucracy, and  for us on the left, it's the corporate oligarchy.   Reich, writing in '86 - '87, anticipating the election of '88, reflecting on Reagan's "government is the problem" view,   argues that both extreme views fail to hold up in the latter half of the 20th century.   He is persuasive (to this liberal, anyway) that the middle way is for government to supply the regulation, the market may then play the game.  For example, he notes the outcome of the deregulation of the airline industry, while it led to the dismissal of the air traffic controllers, also freed the airlines to compete and hold down fares.   He didn't anticipate the growth of short-haul airlines, as such, but his vision can still be applied to the other problems he visits.   [return][return]And in one more i'll-have-to-get-back-to-you, Reich proposes regulation of the public-private nature that is finally coming to be regarded as common place.	4

Not only do today's "people of the book" have much to learn from one another's religions, but each as much from within their own.   He lists fundamental challenges to each of the common trio:   Judaism will have to accept the Exodus story is not historical, and that Yahweh evolved from tribal gods of the region.  Christians will have to accept Jesus' message of love wasn't particularly novel, nor as universal as we've come to believe.  Islam will need to learn (not unlike the other two) that words ascribed to the Prophet were later additions.   Each will have to give up an exclusivity standing in the way of the next level of moral inclusion.[return][return]Wright threads the history with human nature and the evolutionary forces which put us on the path to recognize religious spirituality.  He recognizes the "God gene" as an explanation, but as likely to face erosion as earlier naturalist dieties.	4

The re-read was well worth it.   One might observe Bly anticipated the #metoo moment.  His describes of the decline of both men's and women's lives as a direct result of the industrial revolution, the proximate cause.  The "modern" origins he dates to the 11th C, when story-telling killed off the "Wild Man".  Other reviewers will/have related the binding thread of the myth/legend/story of Iron John, and its appearance in cultures around the world.  It's universal.   [return][return]A single instance where Bly uses history, non-fiction, if you will, is late in the chapter of the Red, White, and Black horses, where Abraham Lincoln is approached in the White House at 5 a.m. by a woman whose son is about to be hanged at 8 a.m.   The good thing about the whole chapter is the leveling of sexual/gender stereotypes.   No color horse is better than any other, Red horses aren't exclusively ridden by women, while or black by men.   They are ridden in different orders to make different points; the different progressions  describe different  growth.[return][return]Most often, Bly introduces an image, by meditating on a section of the Iron John legend.   For example, "Ralph Nader rides a white horse", this without further comment, allowing the reader to make their own judgement about any meaning.  While a reference may slip over contemporary readers' event horizon, a bit of research  supplies the context.[return][return]Risking repetition, the story is timeless.  Bly sheds light on  the now-emerging social issues of the last nearly 30 years.  If he points to a solution, it is this:  "Don't become the Wild Man; instead, get in touch with yours".   And not in identical words, he suggests a similar solution for women.	4.5

[return][return]literarily, his last few chapters are of the and-let-me-get-this-off-my-chest variety.  so, they're not up to the sharp invictive of his earlier ones.   compared to carr, he gives unix it's larger place in the pantheon, and it's not without a proportionate share of the problems, according to laneir.[return][return]lanier woke me up to how software tends to "lock down" certain decisions.  in his case, the midi music format is one of those:  "how do keypresses model rich tonality" is his challenge as a music maker.   well enough.    any bit of software makes choices for us in ways we don't always see.   [return][return]even with taleb's black swan, challenging "the bell curve", i still insist any individual's rating _must_ follow the binomial relationship.  giving lanier's "gadget, U R ~" a 4.0 doesn't disturb the balance of my ratings.	4

No, it's not that I "missed" the physics.  Surely half a point deduction is due to my e-reader attempt.   But a roster of (ten) possible multi-verses.  File this one under the philosophy of science.   Greene offers plausible means for verifying two or three of the candidates.   It's interesting that we are on the verge of such experiments, but this feels like Greene is laying down a marker for the 23 (or later) century.  It was fun speculating on "where" the electron may be:  Grant's Tomb, or Central Park.  The _one_ takeaway is to consider the observer herself must be "located" with quantum considerations as well.	3.5

They date the liberal hour from 1963 to 1966.  Kennedy gets credit for  11 months of the liberal hour, taking the election of '62 which left him majorities in both chambers, and felt the wind at his back.  Johnson made a good deal of the momentum Kennedy left him, and used JFK's death as a call to his agenda.  Johnson was the man, possibly ever in Capitol Hill history to bring home a complete legislative package.   The authors point to Johnson's hubris and the liberal faults which led to programs they couldn't fulfill[return][return]The book separates the issues of the time as separate chapters, and treats them as if they had a cabinet portfolio. The Liberal Hour is therefore, not a diary, a chronology.  The issues of the day interlaced, not only in the minds of the White House, but in the figures of the time For all the progress towards the Great Society, the quote from Dr King sums it up, paraphrasing.  Viet Nam ended the Great Society.[return][return]The authors point to the confluence of the three branches achieving a liberal synergy, and offer a thorough review of the Warren court to the hour.  While they have placed '63 - '66 as its highest point, they say that with the appointment of Warren Burger as Chief Justice in Nixon's first days in '69, the Liberal Hour was over and every one knew it.	4

His best time in the 100 m was 10.4, his prime, as Louie, would have been the '40 games.  (Gernot doesn't show up as a 100 m contestant at Berlin, I suspect that he, like Louie, raced at longer distance).[return][return]To "Unbroken":  a compelling read, Hillenbrand draws you forward.   The  _only_ thing I didn't enjoy was the occasional repetition of facts and impressions.  Her narration allows you to assume different futures to the characters and their relationships.   So, while certain bits couldn't have been recorded without at least _one_ survivor  (I'm reminded of Woodward's recounting of Nixon and Kissinger alone on an elevator!), the raft-ride by Mac, Phil, and Louie does leave a few balls in the air.   Hillenbrand has the knack for presenting Louie's next adventure as an open possibility.    While some of the post-war trans-Pacific action is out of sequence, it didn't distract from the interest and impact, considering the competing value shift and position hardening on either side.	4.5

I loved the interplay between Anastasia's mother and mother-in-law, and the three of their pets.  Her sons fill the role of the oblivious teen.  I'll be looking for more development there and the boys adulation of  Zack, the "hunk" in the garage.   Winston, having graduated from the romance form, knows how to create the necessary sexual tension.  While she gets in her digs at our NJ precincts -- "they all use the same pencil stubs to write in the same notebooks"  -- they are redeemed in the end.  I enjoyed the side-trip to "Horse Thief Falls", MN.   While not quite Kiellor-esque, it reminded this MN native of the real "Thief River Falls".  I was able to pat myself on the back for having figured out "whodunnit" early,  except ! ... the individual I had fingered was actually someone else.   This clever plot ploy is not quite, but close to the operatic device of mistaken identity.	3.5

Set close to our club's reading "The Invention of Nature: .. Humboldt ..", Wulf,  this book brings us back to the early 19th Century.   These two show, in practical terms, the activity which brought us "The Age of Wonder".   How science moved out of "natural philosophy", and allows us to employ scientists as professionals, no longer amateurs.

A visit to Jefferson confirmed the President's natural instincts, providing any remaining inspiration to explore the continent west of Monticello.  Interestingly, Pat's and my engagement, in Zurich, happened on the 100th anniversary of the 100th Anniversary celebration of Humboldt's birth.   Wulf brings this near past into vivid context, as if we had lived in the time when news took it's time.    In so doing, helps us appreciate Humboldt's impact in his own day.	4

Lilla's book, for me is a solid 4. I also believe in, and rank my weightings in a binomial distribution, with no rated book getting lower than a 2.5.[return][return]In any case, I read The Shipwrecked Mind as an antidote to my creeping anxiety over Tuesday's election.[return][return]On that score, I'm now prepared to read, say Leo Strauss, whose U of Chicago credentials, and his acknowledged worship by the reactionary right in this country would have scared me off prior to this read.  [return][return]Of my six grandchildren, half are in Jewish lineage.  Lilla's treatment of Franz Rosenzweig lifts my spirits to  understand that part of their inheritance. His treatment of the Jewish and Christian places in history, and especially how each regards that place was illuminating and hopeful.   He leads us through Rosenzweig's  'The Star of Redemption'.. " and by far the richest, is a startling sociological comparison of Jewish and Christian ways of life".   This is immediately followed by (unsurprisingly, when we encounter it) "Rosenzweig dismisses Islam as a mere parody of revealed religion".[return][return]My only disappointment was his concluding chapter when he serializes columns he wrote for the NY Review of Books while he was in Paris in the aftermath of the Charlie Hebdo attacks in January, 2015.   He introduces French writers, Eric Zemmour and Michel Houellebecq, the latter who was fortunate (as France was not) to have a book come out on the eve of the attacks.  His review helps to understand the French struggle with their own history.   At the moment, I can't give this sufficient energy to be interested.

That because O'Brien's completed his anti-war argument my the time the platoon arrives in the Song Tra Bong.   He doesn't struggle with the difficult task of explaining a true war story.   And that war stories need neither an ending nor make a point to be true.   For me, a careful re-read, collecting annotations will guide my story-telling efforts, the chapter "How To Tell a True War Story" as the guide.   The chapters are short stories in themselves, but his characters live through them, even after they are factually "dead".	4.5

Seeing the movie in the middle of the reading probably scalped half a point from my rating.    However seeing the movie restored my focus on the main characters: Kathy Goble Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson.   As an engineer, I was attracted to Mary's progress from computer to engineer and the barriers she had to break down.   Allowing a personal note, the book also amplified something we learned in the late '70s:  when computers became programmers of computers, engineers' first thought was computing is an engineering tool.  My wife, at the UCCS and the Engineering Dept Head were the first to bring a computer scientist to the department.   Dorothy's figuring out, on her own, to pick up FORTRAN and share it with West shows a lesson, an insight we need more of today.  Katherine's expertise served her, and John Glenn well.  I suspect her  analytic geometry skill was an easier explain then the necessary skill of spherical trigonometry. (calculating a splash-down point to the last decimal in latitude, longitude).  the book did a better job with that than the movie.   Since i've made much reference to the movie,  here's a map between the two.   The movie picks up at the midpoint of the book, missing everything up to the choice of the Mercury astronauts.  Hence, a number of milestones, advances made more on the initiative of the women are folded into the time-line of the movie, well after they occurred:  Mary Jackson's admission to night school at Hampton High, Kathy's liberation from the "colored women restroom". The movie gives a comic scene of her scampering back and forth from color-absent Space group to the friendlier West Computing.  The book offers a more subtle explanation:  "since the rest room in the Space group said 'womens rest room' i assumed i wasn't excluded".  And Dorothy's repeated petition for supervisor status are at least 4, 5 years later, not that it matters.   The book doesn't disappoint.   It's speaking right at me, since I'd have been one of the people who could have taken advantage of the computers' work.   My disappointment is not having known of their work 45, 50 years ago.	4
physics, time, cosmology	Your library, IntheHouse, have read, shelved	QB991 .Q36	138839122	Time Reborn: From the Crisis in Physics to the Future of the Universe	Smolin, Lee	1	amazon.com books	[2017-02-13]	Barnes & Noble Booksellers - Freehold	352 		[2017-03-24]	[2017-04-04]	[2017-05-10]	[0544245598]	0544245598, 9780544245594		530.12			Smolin has a point:   this business of timelessness needs a re-think.   At the risk of sounding arrogant, his community shrinks because of his argument.   I'm one of those curious, who likes to think i can appreciate what the serious thinkers think.   I didn't say understand; i'm not that arrogant.   But I think I'm clever enough to appreciate what's at stake.    A recent reading of the Tao of Physics resurrected any recollection I had that quantum physics now tells us that time is an emergent property, rather than fundamental.   At least according to the largest part of that community.  I think many (most?) well-read people would find that a novel idea.  So do I.    So, I start this book in sympathy with where Smolin is going.  He carefully lays out his plan.   To paraphrase "First, let's see how time lost it's unquestioned status as fundamental", then he says he'll see why that has to be rethought.   This is an honest approach for a scientist.   "I'm with you, Lee".   And he's thorough.   By the end of Part I, he's taken us from Newton thru Einstein and Bohr, when in the 20's (I guess) "time" lost it's place in the equation's denominator.[return][return]His restoring time on scientific grounds comes from cosmological questions:  Einsteins forsaking the cosmological constant, and since his death, the need to insert it back to explain newer observations.  I can appreciate (recall, not the same as understanding) that now, dark matter and dark energy explain the need for a cosmological constant, and help to model the observations.   Smolin argues that physical laws have evolved in this universe to explain the measured changes in the distribution of the universe's constituents: photons, stars (matter), energy, and the dark versions.  And evolution implies passage of time.   The initial conditions and the "selection" of fundamental constants receive pro and con arguments.  So too, the possibility of multiple (infinite numbers of) universes, and a single infinite universe.    As his scope widens, his audience narrows.     The problem he's trying to solve matters to fewer and fewer people.  He confesses his real motive in the epilogue, where he sums up his argument as the need for a new philosophy.  I suspect literary critics could easily tease out the circularity of his reasoning.   To me, it's not unlike a local pastor of my witness who complains about those who complain, failing to see himself in that club.   I rationalize my rating of 3* on my belief one's ratings should be a binomial distribution.  Since the lowest I will go is 2.5, and I only allow a handful of books at that rating, this book is not one of those.	3

The narrative was better, otherwise engaging.  His introduction, where he clarifies the definitions of precision and accuracy assured my complete read.   "Books are a lot like NYC, five minutes in either may be enough" -- Bob Johnson, 1965.	3

While the history is mainly of men, this does not discredit the association, industrial and academic, which led to innovation.  Simcoe doesn't dwell on the workers strife and international competition, both are reviewed.   These events serve to focus, at the dawn of the 21st C, how metals made America and vice-versa.	3

In full disclosure, I met Rod Manis when the book was in pre-publication. I built the system on the Korn Shell of the day: 1987, and am maintaining, upgrading a version on bash today. The difference is, it's all functions, no command files. A function library to source and you're good to go. My objective in owning a copy is to complete a full implementation. The open areas of my /rdb: ve, and index. I now have some tables where it will be worthwhile for an index.
