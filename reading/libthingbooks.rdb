25304205	The Plot Against America	Roth, Philip	4	reading some reviews, i was glad to pick up on roth's mother's heroism and the impact of the stamp collection and its influence on sandy's artistry.[return][return]and i take notice of the reviews that give this a poor rating.  some for saying he didn't deliver on the potential.    i saw an interview with roth a few months ago, and while tempting, roth advises us not to draw too close parallels to today's conflicts.  [return][return]this book reminds me of sinclair lewis' "it can't happen here". and i try to imagine what/when/where a third book about the facist potential in america will come from.   if roth is preaching, it's thru his father, and how he comes to decide, for example to not move to canada, when others are doing it;  the value of "place".  his struggles with alvin and sandi, whether to carry a gun or not.[return][return]i reside quite close to the area of newark and surrounding towns, and am tempted to hop in the car after a google-maps planning session.   the trip early in the book where he describes the family's potential relocation to union twp gave me a wry smile:  i used to commute through the neighborhood.   [return][return]one could draw other dimensions from this book about today's struggles -- about drugs in the same ghettos,  the fear of young children too old too fast from the violence in the streets;   the parade of apartment dwellers through the first floor unit, their different strengths and weaknesses.[return][return]a person more well-read than myself assures me this is a very different roth book.   i want to read more of his work.

He also explores the social and politcal history that shaped the church's view of women's role and how and why the early anti-jewish sentiment lodged itself in the church.

Other than collecting the stories, she's not too heavily invested in this book, though she shares her story.   some are more genuine than others.   for example, Andrew Sullivan, on the right, is much more sincere than Bill O'Reilly, who is not possible to ascribe an honesty to after watching any of his on-air rants, such as a recent (10/2) one with Barney Frank.   The stories are from across the age and outlook spectra.   One criticism for the general audience is she has too many Irish Catholic in evidence.   Some, Gabriel Byrne, for example were more entertaining than the more likely of, say, Frank McCourt.   In the end, her book affirms some decisions I've made about my faith lately.

39917617	Vermeer's Hat: The Seventeenth Century and the Dawn of the Global World	Brook, Timothy	3.5	Brook's point came home with his including John Donne's "No man is an island" quote.   Brook had already introduced what we should now begin to call Web 0.1, with the expansion of global trade, and indeed a circuit around the world.  American myopia has a hard time imagining a 17th century world not focused on Jamestown and Plymouth Rock.   Tobacco was a big part of the global trade, and as Brook points out, through the 19th c, and only diminishing at the dawn of the 21st.    But it was hardly the cornerstone of the global market.   Human traffic, porcelain, arms, christianity, national hegemony, were the big exports of the 17th c. [return][return]i might have rated higher were it not for the difficult time i had following the Dutch-Portuguese struggles in the China Sea and related lands.   I know where Japan and Korea are, but am not at all familiar with the latitudes of the Chinese mainland ports.   (e.g. -- without -- or before encountering the map -- I must have confused Goa with Macao ).

65984071	American Pastoral	Roth, Philip	4.5	Let's make this one the "book of the aughts's decade", even though it was penned in the mid-90s. I"m giving it the 5 stars, one of very few in my catalog, since, on p 287, we hear, "These so-called patriots", Lou Levov said to Dawn, "would take this country and make Nazi German out of it. You know the book ``It Can't Happen Here''? There's a wonderful book, I forget the author, but the idea couldn't be more up-to-the-moment. These people have taken us to the edge of something terrible. ``Look'' at that son of a bitch. "[return][return]--- this was set in '73 during the Watergate investigation. and couldn't be more applicable than today. It caught my attention, because the forgotten author is someone Roth has in his pre-frontal cortex: Sinclair Lewis. Roth's recent "Plot Against America" recalls Lewis '34 work most vividly.

The Unvanquished, for me, is a sufficient benchmark of Faulkner's work.

Early in the decade of the aughts, I came to learn of their funding the hidden right-wing money pool.  I had been on the way to donating in the hundreds of dollars to the school.  On learning of their 'buying respectability', i immediately cut my donation to a dollar per year per year, This year (2016) it reaches $50.   The first few years after cutting my donation back, the undergraduate solicitor hadn't heard of the Koch brothers.   I'd ask her to shout out to the boiler room; at first the name was unknown, later met with "I can tell you", and finally with derisive shouts.[return][return]My hope is that Mayer's book takes its place with "The Jungle" in leading to sustained rolling back of Citizen's United, the concept of corporate person-hood, and any derivative effect.  Just over two years ago I was involved with the NJOCU, -- the New Jersey coalition to Overturn Citizen's United.   My take-away is that, among the coalition is that it was no-one's first issue, but everyone's second issue.  It's the thing which stands in the way of any meaning political progress.  Coalition members represented clean air and water (no fracking), gun-control, voting rights, wage equity, human rights, ...

Chernow presents an even-handed view of Hamilton, warts and all, but he also makes it clear how essential Hamilton was to the American story. Thomas Jefferson comes across very poorly, but it doesn't feel like it's Jefferson-bashing, it feels like truth. My only comment would be that there are too many "Could this be why he did that?" questions without any real basis.

It's not perfect by any standard, but it was definitely a page turner for me. The book, as everyone knows, has been compared endlessly to "Gone Girl." I actually probably enjoyed this more than "Gone Girl," which like, but not as much as some of Flynn's other books. Oddly enough, I did read "The Girl on the Train" the day after watching "Gone Girl" on film for the first time, so all of that was swirling in my head.

DeRose, Chris		In 1789, James Madison and James Monroe ran against each other for Congressthe only time that two future presidents have contested a congressional seat.[return][return]But what was at stake, as author Chris DeRose reveals in Founding Rivals: Madison vs. Monroe, the Bill of Rights, and the Election That Saved a Nation, was more than personal ambition. This was a race that determined the future of the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the very definition of the United States of America.[return][return]Friends and political allies for most of their lives, Madison was the Constitution’s principal author, Monroe one of its leading opponents. Monroe thought the Constitution gave the federal government too much power and failed to guarantee fundamental rights. Madison believed that without the Constitution, the United States would not survive.	Hardcover	336 				us history, presidents		[159698192X]	973.5	1	[2016-05-09]
129966704	American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer	Bird, Kai		2016-06-27[return][return]American Prometheus is the first full-scale biography of J. Robert Oppenheimer, “father of the atomic bomb,” the brilliant, charismatic physicist who led the effort to capture the awesome fire of the sun for his country in time of war. Immediately after Hiroshima, he became the most famous scientist of his generation–one of the iconic figures of the twentieth century, the embodiment of modern man confronting the consequences of scientific progress.[return][return]He was the author of a radical proposal to place international controls over atomic materials–an idea that is still relevant today. He opposed the development of the hydrogen bomb and criticized the Air Force’s plans to fight an infinitely dangerous nuclear war. In the now almost-forgotten hysteria of the early 1950s, his ideas were anathema to powerful advocates of a massive nuclear buildup, and, in response, Atomic Energy Commission chairman Lewis Strauss, Superbomb advocate Edward Teller and FBI director J. Edgar Hoover worked behind the scenes to have a hearing board find that Oppenheimer could not be trusted with America’s nuclear secrets.

But McCullough is so in love with American history, and the people who made it, that he sweeps you along and even when I found and essay less interesting I hung in there, knowing it would pay off somehow.

138059064	The Glass Universe: How the Ladies of the Harvard Observatory Took the Measure of the Stars	Sobel, Dava	4	2018-10-10[return] [return]In the mid-nineteenth century, the Harvard College Observatory began employing women as calculators, or “human computers,” to interpret the observations made via telescope by their male counterparts each night. At the outset this group included the wives, sisters, and daughters of the resident astronomers, but by the 1880s the female corps included graduates of the new women's colleges—Vassar, Wellesley, and Smith. As photography transformed the practice of astronomy, the ladies turned to studying the stars captured nightly on glass photographic plates. The “glass universe” of half a million plates that Harvard amassed in this period—thanks in part to the early financial support of another woman, Mrs. Anna Draper, whose late husband pioneered the technique of stellar photography—enabled the women to make extraordinary discoveries that attracted worldwide acclaim.

He compares not doing this to treating a lung cancer patient with chemo but not getting him to stop smoking. The book is full of detailed instances of ignorance and willful stupidity, but still rings with an unmistakable love for this unique ecosystem. I grew up in Michigan, in the very midst of these lakes, and was chagrined to find I didn't know much about them, which of course is a large part of the problem. The book was a finalist for the Pulitzer, and it's easy to see why.	Paperback	384 				nature, environment, ecology	Wishlist	[0393355551]	577.630977	1	[2018-04-11]

He had a significant role in the Radiation Lab at MIT, which developed and refined radar into an effective weapon during World War II. Loomis invented and had the patent for Loran (the long-range navigation system predecessor to GPS).

In those vast spaces of the west there is time to understand how our country has diverged into interior and exterior, globally focused and isolationist.[return]Regarding the title, perhaps he is making an analogy between the historical small dispersed outposts of the west having succeeded in establishing government over time and our current policy of dealing with the complexity of the world by a variety of small dispersed methods. I had to work at getting this analogy but in the end, I did see his point.

161500140	Origin Story: A Big History of Everything	Christian, David		2020-12-09[return][return]An astonishing history, from big bang to the present. The author is a professor of history at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia. His background was in Russian history, but over 20 years ago he developed an interest in world history, history across the globe. That wasn’t enough for him, so he began teaching big history, beginning with the physics of the big bang. Bill Gates funded this to be taught in schools, and David Christian taught it at university in a modern history department. Science merges with history as he argues that analogous forces were at work in the development of the universe, the creation of earth, the formation of life, and then human epochs. His insight is that this is an origin story, one not just for one nation or one language, but for all people.

169770370	The Second Kind of Impossible: The Extraordinary Quest for a New Form of Matter	Steinhardt, Paul		2020-06-10[return][return]In the "MIT-HaveRead" Collection, this comment field records the meeting date, followed by someone's review as an introduction to the members of the MIT Club of Princeton.[return][return]Summary: A narrative of the search for a new form of matter, first theorized, then synthesized, and then first found in a mineral collection of questionable provenance that gave tantalizing hints that it might really exist.[return][return]This is a real science detective story. It has all the hopeful leads and unsettling reverses of a detective mystery, and one where the lead character, in this case the lead researcher, finds himself in a situation far removed from the normal environs of a theoretical physicist.[return][return]It begins with the question of whether an impossible five-fold symmetry could be possible under some circumstance. Then Paul Steinhardt, and a graduate student, Dov Levine, began began looking for a loophole to the forbidden five-fold symmetry, and found it, suggesting the possibility for something they termed quasi-crystals. Meanwhile, in another lab, a researcher synthesized a compound that turned out to have the predicted electron diffraction pattern. It takes the two labs a couple years to find out about each other but it demonstrates that something that seems impossible can actually exist, hence the title of this book, coming from Richard Feynman’s response to a paper by Steinhardt, who had been mentored by him. It was the kind of impossible that defies known knowledge but has an intriguing logic to it.	Hardcover	400 				physics, matter, science	MIT - HaveRead	[1476729921]	530.4	1	[2019-06-13]
169770397	Limits to Growth: The 30-Year Update	Meadows, Donella H.		0[return]2019-06-13[return][return]Everyone with children or grandchildren should read this book, a thirty year update to the original Limits to Growth, which suggested that the global population was using the planet's resources far faster than they could be replaced. Thirty years ago their first book was largely ignored, and in this edition, published in 2004, they found the situation far more dire. There is plenty of proof to back up their statements, but the science is presented in a very readable manner. Curious about what the authors thought now, ten more years later, I found an interview with one, Dennis Meadows. He has dropped out of the field, discouraged, and now believes there is no hope for recovery at all.

Lepore deserves much credit for a gallant attempt to capture the changes over five centuries of history, immigration, politics, and technological advances that no one dreamed of when our founding fathers established their vision of self-government. Much research obviously went into this book. The clear and perceptive writing is enhanced by many illustrations that add to the comprehension of an intricate and often perplexing overview of history.

Her relationship with her husband must overcome the weight of secrets and danger of wars. Her codebreaking work is puzzle solving with thousands of lives at stake. There are sneaky Nazi plots, a conniving Hoover, and the dawn of the NSA. Fargone also brings the science of codebreaking into Elizebeth’s story. His use of visual comparisons and detailed examples makes codebreaking interesting. He makes observations about Elizebeth’s story, codebreaking, and history that at times feel poetic. For instance, on codebreaking he says “the basic unit of their [Elizebeth and her husband] life was not the equation but the word” (xii). The Woman Who Smashed Codes offers a fascinating biography, a story of an intelligent and courageous woman, a look at 1890s-1980s history, and espionage history.

It was such a desolate place; the Osage thought they would be safe from settlers wanting their land. Then oil was discovered underground and the rush was on. Suddenly, Osage headright holders became the wealthiest people in the world, and it seemed everyone wanted in.[return][return]Back then in the 1920s, Osage County, Oklahoma was one of the most chaotic places in the country. Thus, when the family of Mollie Burkhart, an Osage Indian woman, started dying, no one really seemed to notice at first. As more of her family continued to die off, the FBI became involved. What unfolded was layer upon layer of deception, corruption, and murder. This page-turning tale of murder and lies is one that you won’t be able to put down.

For those reviewers who doubt that this story is true- don't. In high school I had a terrific friend whom I confided in, later we stopped being friends because she just couldn't believe my reality. I err to the side of believing people and Tara seems to have come to terms with her childhood, which certainly isn't easy. This story isn't about Mormon's or preppers- it is a story of an American family that merely lives far enough out of the society that they can fly under the radar. I couldn't put it down although it made me angry, and sad. I'm so happy that the author was able to get out, stay out and make a life for herself.
