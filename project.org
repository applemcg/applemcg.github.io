** Approval and Board Update Steps 

1. You and I discuss the Q&A and approach/plan below in detail by Zoom
   or phone.

1. We review with Don by Zoom, get agreement on appropriate level of
   the detail to discuss with the Board (e.g. written summary sent to
   them in advance, brief review answering questions in Jan 7th
   meeting), who we recommend to participate in the review of the new
   site before switching over, etc.

1. We update the Board on Jan 7th and get approval to proceed.

1. Complete the migration over the next 30 days. 

1. Update the Board by email and at the Feb 4th meeting.

** Terms:

+ /Migration/ - after initial sign-up, the current content is
  available at *the new host* an un-published *i.e. privage* web (IP) address

  available in the new web (IP) address.
+ /IP/ -- Internet Protocol, a physical address e.g. 192.185.28.7 is
  where *stonebridgemensclub.com* is currently found. *This
  behind-the-scenses number changees when we switch to a new host.*

** Q&A

1. Why are we migrating?   

    + while cost (save 100/yr) is helpful, the real reason is to show
      ourselves we aren't at the mercy of a single hosting vendor,
      *gain experience with migration and east of transfer
      ("portability")*

1. what is a hosting company? 

   + a software services company that houses the website and supplies:

        + file and media storage
        + conventional Content Management Software (in our case
          //Wordpress//) with operational plugins for backup, media
          update, event management, etc... the features relevant to a
          business
        + optional features such as routine backup, software update, ..

1. What new hosting company are we migrating to and why were they
   selected?  

    + We've chosen *Hostgator* over *A2 Hosting* and *Dreamhost*,
      while the costs are competitive, Hostgator does the up-front
      migration at no charge handlineg the two necessary backups, and
      restore as part of the 3-year cost.  These are 3 hosting
      companies listed among the top 5 of CNET's (a top tech website)
      recommended providers/

1. What are the costs and savings over time? 

    + 3 years prepaid $98.83 ($32.94/year), following 
      $107.40 / yr. Current site fee to Greg Smith $230/year. 

1. What payment will be required and when?  

    + $98.83, at registration
    + and if completed in 30 days, good for 3 year
    + otherwise annual fee at completion.

1. Any one-time conversion cost?  

    + No if we commit to the switch with Hostgator within 30 days of
      their free migration.

1. Who will perform the services Greg Smith had provided (backups,
   software updates, template enhancements, other)?

    + we will, Mark, Marty, Jim
    + email forwarding registration,
      eg. president@stonebridgemensclub.com
    + administrative accounts
    + routine backups, (e.g. or at a modest additional fee, possibly
      suitable later, not propsed for this conversion)

1. Does the new hosting site require or provide any changes to the
   site, administration & security software, backup and update
   procedures?

    + none what-soever.  the central tools, Wordpress content
      management and cPanel backup software are conventional and
      industry standards

1. How will we ensure the web site is migrated with all web pages,
   content, features and capabilities of the old one?  

    + we have a Test plan checklist for site appearance and user
      operation, including images, text, forms, and user input

    + ancillary operational features will be tested for image, text
      update, event posting
    + admin features fo backup, user andmin will be exercised
    + an evaluation will be performed for site response time

1. Will Board members be invited to review the new site before it goes
   live? 

    + Yes, Mike, Jim, Stan, ...

1. How long will the migration take? 

    + 5-7 days for technical transfer by Hostgator.  
    + How long will the review period be by the tech group?  By the Board?
    + from the 2nd day after migration, the remainder of the 30 days.

1. Will there be any interruption to site access? Will members notice
   anything?

    + only for a heartbeat at DNS transfer
    + the only evidence will be the page-footer hosting agent
      information which will change from Gregg Smith to Hostgator

1. When will you migrate the site?  Project plan to date and remaining
   tasks:

    + migration start: January 8, given Board approval
    + migration complete: ~ Jan 14,
    + available for board review: ~ Jan 16
    + DNS Transfer: February 4, 5

1. Does the migration impact or benefit email management and operation
   or any other technical or SMC functions (marketing, activities,
   fundraising, etc.)?

    + marketing, i.e. routine email is unchanged
    + forwarding to officers  president, entertainment, membership, ...
      will seamlessly be able to  move to "{officer}@stonebridgemensclub.com", 
      as separate post-transfer task.

1. When does Greg Smith have to be notified? 

    + early January, two questions:

        + we plan on moving our host, when does our plan with you expire?
        + given we make the move, 

1. What assurance do we have and confirmation do we get that Greg
   Smith deletes all copies of our website, content, etc. on his site?
   (except for reasonable reference user of page[s]).

1. Other?
